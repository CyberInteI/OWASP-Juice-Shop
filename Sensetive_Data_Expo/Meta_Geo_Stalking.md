### Step 2: Extract Metadata Using ExifTool

### Step 3: Analyze GPS Coordinates
Using Google Maps, I searched for the location corresponding to those coordinates. The place pointed to the Daniel Boone National Forest, which is known for hiking activities.

### Step 4: Reset Password via Security Question

Next, I initiated the Forgot Password mechanism for Johnâ€™s account. His security question was:

"Whatâ€™s your favourite place to go for hiking?"

I entered the answer as:
```html
Daniel Boone National Forest
```
